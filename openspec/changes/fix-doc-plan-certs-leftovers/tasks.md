## 1. Implementation
- [x] Identify leftover cert path mentions in documentation_plan.md.
- [x] Replace certs/local-ca/ca.crt with shared/certs/local-ca/ca.crt.
- [x] Add canonical path note (Ruta canónica de certs: shared/certs/ (CERTS_DIR)). (Already present.)

## 2. Verification
- [x] Confirm no certs/local-ca/ca.crt remains in documentation_plan.md.
- [x] Confirm documentation_plan.md mentions shared/certs/ as canonical.
