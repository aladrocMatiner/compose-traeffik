# Change: Improve documentation onboarding accuracy

## Why
New contributors can be blocked by placeholder clone commands and stale doc planning references that no longer match the current docs layout.

## What Changes
- Replace placeholder clone commands with a concrete repo URL and directory name in the quickstart.
- Align the documentation plan references with the current docs structure so guidance is consistent.

## Impact
- Affected specs: documentation
- Affected code: README.md, README.sv.md, README.es.md, documentation_plan.md
