## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Inspect the root README endpoint sections and confirm the DNS UI entry is missing or inconsistent.
- [x] 1.2 Update `README.md` to include the DNS UI endpoint entry with the correct URL and profile/auth notes.
- [x] 1.3 Mirror the DNS UI endpoint entry in `README.es.md` and `README.sv.md` with matching intent.

## 2. Verification
- [x] 2.1 The endpoint lists in all three README files include `https://dns.${BASE_DOMAIN}` with the `dns` profile note.
