## 1. Implementation
- [x] Confirm non-portable grep usage in DNS smoke test.
- [x] Choose a POSIX-compatible whitespace matcher.
- [x] Update the DNS profile line check to use the portable matcher.
- [x] Keep scope limited to the whitespace check only.

## 2. Verification
- [x] Ensure the check matches both `- dns` and `  - dns` forms.
- [x] Add a brief manual verification example (if needed). (Pattern covers both forms.)
- [x] Confirm tasks reflect the applied change.
