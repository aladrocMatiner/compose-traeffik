# Traefik Dynamic Configuration: Middlewares

    # --- HTTP to HTTPS Redirect Middleware ---
    # This middleware automatically redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
    # It's applied by default to the 'web' entrypoint via traefik/traefik.yml.
    redirect-to-https:
      redirectScheme:
        scheme: https
        permanent: true # Use 301 Permanent Redirect
        # Only activate if HTTP_TO_HTTPS_REDIRECT is 'true'
        # Traefik doesn't have direct if conditions in middlewares,
        # so this middleware is always defined but its application is conditional
        # via Traefik's dynamic router rules (or entrypoint config in static).
        # We handle the toggle for the 'web' entrypoint dynamically in traefik.yml,
        # but for individual routers, they would explicitly call this.
        # The entrypoint rule `middlewares: ["redirect-to-https@file"]` will always apply
        # to the 'web' entrypoint unless removed from static config.
